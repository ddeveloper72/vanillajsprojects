# Infinite Scroll blog

## The Specifications

* The UI is designed to display a number of fake blog entries, index, heading and body
* The UI displays a custom animated CSS loader
* Scrolling done the posts will prompt a get request to the API for another page of blog posts
* A search function searches post loaded to the DOM, filtering out all other posts
