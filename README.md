# Vanilla JS Projects

Selection of JavaScript applications re-created and in some cases added to, for my own development experience.

## Deployment

This applet can be run from live server, or from a remote host, such as GitHub pages.

Live versions of these applications are currently being hosted on Google's Firebase.
